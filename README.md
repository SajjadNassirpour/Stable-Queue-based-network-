# Stable-Queue-based-network
Using LP to stabilizing the Queue-based network.\
This is the course project for MATH5593 Linear Programming at the University of Colorado-Denver, Fall 2019. 
Student contributors: Sajjad Nassirpour and John McFarlane
In this project, we explore a strategy determined by linear programming to stabilize queues in a multicast communication network. The strategy maximizes the communication rate with no loss of packets. We define the constraints in order to have # of incoming packets<# of outcoming packets in every queue.
